# YAIM0425 d03b – Robots with Immunity 🤖🛡️

## 📦 Description

**YAIM0425 d03b – Robots with Immunity** adds special versions of construction and logistic robots that are **immune to damage**.

This MOD creates:

* 🤖 **One robot per damage type**, fully immune to that specific damage
* 🧿 **One ultimate robot** that is immune to **all damage types**

These robots are designed for extreme environments where normal robots would be constantly destroyed.

## ⚙️ How it works (Player view)

* The MOD creates **copies** of the vanilla construction and logistic robots
* These robots behave exactly like normal robots
* The only difference is their **damage immunity**, depending on the variant
* The ultimate version cannot be damaged by any source

No configuration is required. Just craft and use them.
